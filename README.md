# Stadplatz: A chat/forum hybrid for students attending USC. This project was made using Eclipse. 

Currently, Stadplatz is functional; if we were to deploy it now, students could create and log into accounts, join classes, create and replly to posts, and discuss their classes.

Some issues that were purposely not addressed include awkward layout arrangements when the window is significantly smaller than full-screen and some of the CSS code is not supported by all browsers (use Google Chrome for optimal viewing).
