# Stadtplatz

Currently Stadtplatz is functional; if we were to deploy it now, students could discuss their classes. CSS is complete, 
except for some issues when the window is significantly smaller than full-screen.
Soon we will auto-update a user's screen when another user makes a post (so that the first user does not need to refresh 
to observer the changes).
